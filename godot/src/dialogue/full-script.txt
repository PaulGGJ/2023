Intro
MC: Hello
S0: World

Ravi-green
[Overworld dialogue when you approach Ravi]
R: You got one of those slimes to follow you around?
MC: Yeah! I think this one's special, it's more friendly than the others. Wonder if I could take it home.
S0: {slime noises}
MC: Wait, do you have one too?
R: Yeah... they're kind of gross, but I guess if some of them are friendly, it's good to have them join you for protection.
R: Mine's been fighting every other slime it sees to get stronger.
S0: {slime noises}
MC: What's that, buddy?
MC: Wait, you want to get stronger too?
R: Um...
R: If yours wants to fight mine, maybe they'll be happy... I don't know if this is a good idea.
[Choice: Fight/Decline]
[If Fight:]
MC: Might as well try! Come on!
[Ravi fight occurs.
[If Decline:]
MC: Maybe later. C'mon, buddy, let's fight some of the other slimes first.
[If Lost:]
R: Do you want to try again?
[Choice: Fight/Decline]
[If Won:]
[If you approach Ravi after his fight]
R: Wow, your slime is so strong!  Even stronger than my monster.
MC: Where did you find that thing, anyway?
R: I found this weirdly shaped artifact, and when I gave it to a friendly slime... well, you saw.
MC: I can't believe Ravi Scared-Of-Everything is going around with monsters.
R: It wasn't my idea...
R: The same thing happened to Diana. She befriended one and it started smiling and joined her.
R: And then the two of them went further into the factory to train.
MC: That sounds like her. Always up for adventure, huh?
R: And then she made me do it too, for protection just in case!
MC: That's not a bad thing. We worry about you.
R: If you're going further in, you should take the artifact.
R: I don't really want it anyway, I just want to go home...
