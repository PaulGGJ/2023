[when you have all the items and return to the tree and the big, torn-up mattress]
NR:O Lord of the Wild, I have returned. I bring accursed items to the altar with which they offended your great roots.
A:Yes, I see. Bring the items forward.
[All the items leave your inventory and appear on the mattress]
A:I will banish these things with my power... The altar and the artifacts will return to the God of Industry's realm.
[The mattress and the items disappear]
A:You have done well, my follower. May they think twice before spreading their influence here again.
NR:And may your great roots spread throughout the world again.
